 - [ ] A easy UI for magnament.
 - [ ] Full integration with Google Calendar and Whatsapp

## Witch tecnologies I'm using.
Here a little list about the tec's that i'm using to make this project
- Deno
- Typescript
- Peer (WebRTC)
- Socket.IO (WebSockets)
- Probabbly React.JS (For UI develop)
- MongoDB (No SQL database, really i hate writing SQL)
- And I use Arch Linux btw

## Why Deno and not NodeJS
'Cause I want to try deno for a real life project, and here's the chance.

## What I'm would like to do with it?
If the lucky smiles me, I'd like to use the project *CarlosNunezMX/SIIAU_API*, for automatic students matching, but i cannot.

I'd like to add a functionality to deattach the class by the teacher doesn't join in the 25 minitues, 'cause so much teachers are doing this.
